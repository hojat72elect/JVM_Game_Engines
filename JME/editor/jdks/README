The JDKs Folder provides the JDKs which are bundled with the SDK when the Installers are made.
You can change the JDK Version in download-jdks.sh, but don’t change anything apart from that if you don’t know what you are doing.

download-jdks.sh also replaces the functionality of build-osx-zip.sh but requires build-package.sh to be in the same folder.

## Experienced Users: ##
We need to download the JDKs for 5 platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOSX).
The Problem is that those JDKs often come in .exe or .dmg files.
download-jdks.sh hence downloads them and extracts the plain jdk folder out of them so they can be used with build-package.sh to create an SFX archive out of them.
Unfortunately this doesn’t work for Mac OSX, so we simply zip the contents there.

I could make the build work under Mac OS 10.9.5, however under Linux you could run into troubles because of the mount command: missing permissions, no hfs-drivers, etc pp.

Also you need p7zip to be installed and many other more usual build-tools.
