DO NOT TRY TO FIX THE IMPORT ERRORS IN THE PROJECTS!!

The product has to be a zip file with a single folder containing the needed files.

To make a new product item, copy an existing item by copying a folder from
stub/ext/components/products and stub/ext/infra/build/products and adapt
the properties files, especially the path to the zip file (product.data.1.path)
as well as the subfolder in the zip containing the files (product.data.sub.dir).

The folder in stub/ext/infra/build/products can be duplicated and adapted for
each platform w/o copying the main project under stub/ext/components/products.

Do not use the helloworld item as a template, this is the main item and has
some more stuff going!

Then adapt the main stub/build.xml in the -build and -clean targets by duplicating
the entries.

The existing JDK item is only used on MacOSX! On other platforms the jdk that is
bundled with the installer is used instead.
